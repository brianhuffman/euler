-- 198. Ambiguous Numbers
{-
A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is
a rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s â‰¤ d, so that any rational
number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q > d.

Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined
for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40
has the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6.
We shall call a real number x ambiguous, if there is at least one
denominator bound for which x possesses two best approximations. Clearly,
an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.

How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q, 0 < x < 1/100, are there whose
denominator q does not exceed 10^8?
