-- 197. Investigating the behaviour of a recursively defined sequence.
{-
Given is the function f(x) = floor(2^(30.403243784-x^2)) Ã— 10-9,
the sequence u(n) is defined by u(0) = -1 and u(n+1) = f(u(n)).

Find u(n) + u(n+1) for n = 10^12.
Give your answer with 9 digits after the decimal point.

{-
2^30.403243784 ~ 1,420,000,000

0 < f(x) <= 1.42

For positive x, f(x) has negative slope.

f has one (unstable) fixed point.
(f . f) has two other fixed points; sequence u converges to this pair.
