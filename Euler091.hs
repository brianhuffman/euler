-- 91. Find the number of right angle triangles in the quadrant.
{-
The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and
are joined to the origin, O (0,0), to form Î”OPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 2.

Given that 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 50, how many right triangles can be formed?
