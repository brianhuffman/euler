Problem 319
08 January 2011

Let x[1], x[2],..., x[n] be a sequence of length n such that:

    * x[1] = 2
    * for all 1 < i ≤ n : x[i-1] < x[i]
    * for all i and j with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n : (x[i])^j < (x[j] + 1)^i

There are only five such sequences of length 2, namely: {2,4}, {2,5},
{2,6}, {2,7} and {2,8}.

There are 293 such sequences of length 5; three examples are given
below: {2,5,11,25,55}, {2,6,14,36,88}, {2,8,22,64,181}.

Let t(n) denote the number of such sequences of length n.
You are given that t(10) = 86195 and t(20) = 5227991891.

Find t(10^10) and give your answer modulo 10^9.
